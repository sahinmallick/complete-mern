    <h1>Basic Understanding of Computer Networks</h1>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <h2>Ever wondered that the internet you are using today on your device so easily how does it work?</h2>
    <h3>Let’s understand this on today’s blog. We will start from zero to a little bit advance and also understand little bit of networking stuffs using very simple language.</h3>
    <h3>First of all, Internet is nothing but connecting two or more devices or computers together. The main goal of internet is to connect computers together and send and receive data from different computers. We can also make our own internet in our home. Suppose we have 4-5 computers in a room and we connect each other with wire, tanaaa!! we have made our internet. This type of internet is known as LAN (Local Area Network). Now let’s suppose, we expanded the area to a wider range like a city like Kolkata. I mean if we connect all the computers using wire (mostly wire, we also use wireless) of Kolkata city and expand the connected computers then these type of internet is known as MAN (Metropolitan Area Network). And like these when we connect all the computers of the world these type of network are called WAN (Wide Area Network). Hold on! of course we will learn how the world’s network are connected and how it is supplied to the world. We will understand all the stuffs one by one. And the network connection of computer is known as Internet.</h3>
    <h3>Now, let’s talk to the interesting part of network that how it is supplied to the whole world, basically simply it is connected using wire. Means big network companies like Amazon etc. has spread wire all over the world, from deep sea to the mountain to your country. And few companies like TATA in India pays money to the companies for getting connection, kind of WIFI connection subscription type. In India, TATA and 1-2 more company has their network headquarters and from the main headquarters they give rent to the ISP(Internet Service Provider) of India like Jio, Siti, Airtel, Alliance, VI etc. And these ISP companies sends network via cable to our house or they establish network tower and using these, they provide wireless internet to us for a certain range (2-4km). That’s it, No Rocket Science! I am attaching an image to make you understand how the wired is spread, Can you see our India? I see a point in Mumbai from where the internet is supplied to Indian ISP’s. I think this is own by TATA group, what do you think?</h3>

    <h2>So, what is network?</h2>
    <h3>Set of devices that are interconnected through the communication or transmission medium. The main purpose of the network is the sharing resource or data. It is called Data Communication.</h3>
    <h2>How did it start?</h2>
    <h3>The cold war is going on between the united states and Russia. They compete to launch the first satellite and Russia launched the first one. And, the united states wants to be first in invention stuff and wants to do some scientific research. So, the united states discovered ARPA(Advance Research Project Agency). The ARPA has buildings in various parts of the united states. To communicate, the united states developed ARPA Net. The ARPA Net has four places University of California(UCLA), the Stanford Research Institute (SRI), the University of California-Santa Barbara (UCSB), and the University of Utah. They are using TCP(Transmission Control Protocol).</h3>

    </div> 
    <h3>After years, more computers and locations were added to ARPA Net. As this is a research project, many people sending research papers. The research paper is referencing the other document. If it's not possible, then WWW comes to a solution.</h3>
    <h3>WWW(World Wibe Web):</h3>
    <h3>WWW is a project that stores the website. It was developed by Tim Berners-lee.WWW allows storage of the data and accesses to the data. The world's first website is <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">here</a> where referencing links is possible. And there is no search engine in it, it is used for hyperlinks.</h3>
    <h3>Till now we have understand how network works, now let’s go to a bit deeper. By the way, are you guys enjoying it? I’m sure you are! okay now let’s understand how the data is transferred from a computer to another computer. I mean if I send a reel to our friend or if you have an IPhone and you are sending him/her a picture on Whatsapp (as good camera comes with good responsibility) so how the content is sent to your friend's device using the wire? like, the reel or the image cannot go to your friend as it is. It breaks into something then delivers to your friend device then again rejoins. So, now we will understand how does it happens.</h3>
    <h3>See, if you ever seen the switch board where 1 is written to the top and 0 to the bottom of the switch, where if I want to turn on the fan I press 1 side and if I want to turn off the fan I press 0. Exactly, electronics gadgets are work like this. Whatever we do, computer does not understand anything except 0 and 1, where 0 means off and 1 means on. Using this on/off signal computer does all and every operations. Every operation we give to the computer it breaks into 0’s ans 1’s, this is also know as machine code(0,1).</h3>
    <h2>Protocols</h2>
    <h3>Let's say you are sending a message using an application and another person is sending a message using another application, then you can't able to communicate. So, we need some sought rules to communicate.</h3>
    <h3>Protocol means a set of rules. The rules are set by the Internet Society. Anyone can able to suggest about the internet by RFC(Request for comments)</h3>
    <h3>There are some protocols:</h3>
    <h3>TCP(Transmission Control Protocol): It will ensure the data reaches to destination and is not corrupted.</h3>
    <h3>UDP(User Datagram Protocol): When you do not want to care about your 100% of your data is reaching or not. Your only priority is the time or speed for sendind data. Ex: Video conferencing</h3>
    <h3>HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol): It is used web browser. How the client and server communicating are comes under HTTP protocol.</h3>

    </div>
    <h3>Now our question is how the data is transferred to another device? When we send something to another computer if goes through several steps of network. These steps are know as OSI(Open System Interconnection) model. Every data goes from the rule of this model. Let’s understand how it goes-</h3>
    <h2>OSI(Open System Interconnection) Model:</h2>
    <h3>It is a model which shows how computers are communicating with each other.</h3>
    <h3>There are seven layers in the OSI model</h3>
    <div class="n-img">
        <img src="https://imgs.search.brave.com/fVd0V9MxMJvjIiy79TpXaoCEjUOXKsC1X2cIpAIrXf8/rs:fit:860:0:0:0/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly90aHVt/YnMuZHJlYW1zdGlt/ZS5jb20vYi9icmlk/Z2Utc3dpdGNoLW9z/aS1uZXR3b3JrLW1v/ZGVsLTI4ODY3Mjc5/LmpwZw" alt="">
    </div>
    <h2>Application Layer:</h2>
    <h3>The application layer allows the users to access the network. It provides a user interface. It's implemented in software. Users interact with the application layer like browsers, messages, etc.</h3>
    <h2>Design issues of the Application Layer</h2>
    <h3>1. Client-server paradigm</h3>
    <h3><ul>
        <li>All the application layer programs are based on the client and server.</li>
        <li>A user at a local site wants to receive a service from a computer of a remote site.</li>
        <li>Ex: A user wants to retrieve a file from remote computers both computers run the programs.</li>
        <li>The local computer runs a program(client) that requests service from another remote program computer(server).</li>
    </ul></h3>
    <h3>2. Addressing</h3>
    <h3><ul>
        <li>Addressing is different based on mechanisms.</li>
        <li>Client-servers communicate with each other using addressing.</li>
        <li>Each application has its own address format.</li>
        <li>Ex: The email address looks like username@gmail.com. And address to access the website on the internet is google.com.</li>
        <li>The application program user uses an alias name instead of an IP address to make the environment convenient for the user by using DNS.</li>
    </ul></h3>
    <h2>DNS is a Domain Name System, DNS maps names to IP addresses of that particular name.</h2>
    <h3>Different services</h3>
    <h3>
        <ul>
        <li>The Application Layer is designed to give different services to the user or user programs.</li>
        <li>The common service of the Application layer is SMTP, FTP, and HTTP.</li>
        </ul>
    </h3>
    <h2>Presentation Layer:</h2>
    <h3>We get the data from an application layer, the data is in the form of words or characters. The presentation converts it into a machine-readable format.</h3>
    <h3>The presentation layer is concerned with the syntax and semantics of the information exchange between two systems.</h3>
    <h3>The presentation layer acts as a Data translator and it performs encoding and decoding and it compresses the data.</h3>
    <h3>Functions of the presentation layer</h3>
    <h3><ul>
        <li>Translation</li>
        <li>Encryption -Protecting the data</li>
        <li>Compression-Reducing the size of the data, in order to reduce the load on the network.</li>
    </ul></h3>
    <h2>Session Layer:</h2>
    <h3>It helps in setting and managing the connections and it enables sending and receiving of data followed by the termination of the connected session.</h3>
    <h3>It is used to establish, maintain and synchronize the interaction between the communicating devices.</h3>
    <h3>Functions of Session Layer</h3>
    <h3><ul>
        <li>Dialogue control</li>
        <li>Synchronization</li>
    </ul></h3>
    <h2>Transport Layer:</h2>
    <h3>Packetizing:</h3>
    <h3>Data received from the session layer is divided into small data units called segments. Every segment contains the port number of the source and destination and sequence number(Resemble the segments in the correct order).</h3>
    <h3>Connection control</h3>
    <h3>Transport layer protocols are divided into two categories:</h3>
    <h3><ol>
        <li>Connection-oriented</li>
        <p>In Connection-oriented, the path is chosen from source to destination.</p>
        <li>Connection less</li>
        <p>In connectionless, no path is chosen and the data can move in any direction.</p>
        <h3>TCP is connection-oriented and UDP is connectionless.</h3>
    <ol>
        <h3>Addressing</h3>
        <h3>In the transport layer, addressing is port addressing. A computer may be running several programs at the same time. The communication at the transport layer is done by the client-server paradigm. like http runs on port number 80, it is a road for transfering data you can say.</h3>
        <h3>Reliability</h3>
        <h3>Reliability means having error control and flow control. Sending transport layer makes sure that the entire message arrives at the receiving transport layer without error. Error control is usually carried out by retransmission.</h3>
    </h3>
    <h2>Network Layer:</h2>
    <h3>It works for the transmission of the received data segment from one computer to another that is located in a different computer.</h3>
    <h3>The network layer is a host-to-host delivery.</h3>
    <h3>Working Principle of Network Layer</h3>
    <h3><ul>
        <h3>Internetworking</h3>
        <li>Internetworking is the logical connecting of heterogeneous physical networks together to look like a single network to the upper layer protocols.It supports data transmission from one network to another network.</li>
        <h3>Packetizing</h3>
        <li>The network layer encapsulates packets received from upper-layer protocols and makes new packets out of them.</li>
        <h3>Routing</h3>
        <li>Routing means making or choosing the path <br>Whenever there are multiple routes to the destination, we must make a decision and choose one route.<br>Each IP packet normally reaches the destination via several routes.<br>The packet can't choose the route, the routes connecting LAN, and WAN makes the decision.</li>
        <h3>Addressing</h3>
        <li>Network layer support only IP address. The address used in the network layer must uniquely and universally define the connection of a host or router to the internet.</li>
        <h3>Fragmentation</h3>
        <li>Simply fragmentation means dividing.<br>A packet can travel through different networks,each router decapsulates the IP packet, process it, and encapsulates it in another frame.</li>
    </ul></h3>
    <h2>Data Link Layer:</h2>
    <h3>The data link layer allows you to directly communicate with the computers. The data unit in the data link layer is called a frame. The main responsibility of the data link layer is the node-to-node delivery of data.</h3>
    <h3><ul>
        <h3>Framing</h3>
        <li>The process of encapsulating the data in a frame coming from an upper layer is called framing. A frame is a manageable unit.</li>
        <h3>Error control</h3>
        <li>It is used to find out if the data is lost or corrupted. Error control is divided into two categories. Error Detection and Error Correction.</li>
        <h3>Flow control</h3>
        <li>It controls the flow of data. It means, how much data the sender has to send before receiving an acknowledgment.</li>
        <h3>Addressing</h3>
        <li>In the data link layer, physical addressing is used. Physical addressing is also called MAC address and local address. The Mac address is 48 bits.</li>
        <h3>Media Access Control</h3>
        <li>The data link layer allows the upper layers of the OSI model to access these frames and it also controls how the data is placed and received from the media using media access controllers.</li>
    </ul></h3>
    <h2>Physical Layer:</h2>
    <h3>The physical layer is the bottom-most layer of the OSI model. It transmits the data bits from one computer to another computer through a physical medium. It establishes, maintains, and deactivates the physical connections. It also performs the synchronization of the bits. And it is directly connected to transmission media.</h3>
    <h3>Functions of the physical layer</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>It defines the transmission mode.</li>
        <li>It defines the type of signal used for transmission.</li>
        <li>It performs the bit-to-signal transformation.</li>
        <li>It defines the way, how two or more devices are connected physically.</li>
        <li>The data in the physical layer is in the form of a sequence of bits and it is transmitted in the form of signals.</li>
    </ul>
